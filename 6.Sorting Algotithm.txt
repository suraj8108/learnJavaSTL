Sorting Algorithm

	Bubble Sort
		-> Time Complexity is O(n^2)
		-> Advatages
			=> Easy to understand
			=> Does not require additional space.
			=> Stable sorting algorithm
		-> Disadvantages
			=> Large data set wont perform well.
		-> Application:
			-> Used in Graphic Designing
			-> Easy to start the learning of sorting.
	
	Quick Sort
		-> Divide and Conquer Algorithm
		-> Picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.
		
		Best Case 
			=> O(nlogN) Occurs when the pivot element is always the middle element dividing the array in two equal parts.
		
		Worst Case
			=> O(n ^ 2) Occurs when array is already sorted.
		
		Advatages:
			=> Divide and Conquer algorithm
			=> No Auxillary space.
			=> Perfoms best in average case.
		Disadvantages
			=> In worst case takes a long time.
			=> Not a stable algorithm. If two element having same key there order is not preserved.
		Application:
			=> Government Organization
			=> Computer Graphics
			=> Network Routing
			=> Lubrary Functions
			
	Merge Sort:
		-> Divide and Conquer startegy
		-> Stable algorithm
		
		Advantages:
			-> Stablity, Guranteed worst case performance.
		
		Disadvantages:
			-> Space Complexity
			-> Not in place
			-> Slower than quick sort
